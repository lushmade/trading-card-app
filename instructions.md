We are building an app for creating sports trading cards.
Instructions:

I’m mainly looking for a site that uploads the original photo (cropped to user’s adjustment), any form responses (name, position, number, team, photo cred), and the final image with trading card design to AWS

And for users to adjust the crop with drag and drop instead of the sliders

please read ~/dev/austin-site to see how I use SST for my projects
please read gpt-pro-response.md to see the rough AI plan.
please read ~/dev/tanstack-hono-start/ for a good example of how to use Hono with TanStack and evaluate if we should build off of that.
please read ~/dev/usqc2025/ for last year's trading card app. We will not be reusing anything including design or code, but you can see how it worked. We want to rebuild it better from scratch.
